# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ 
## I urgently need non-technical contributions to complete my project.

If youre intrested please continue reading

I am generating the audio listening functionality through edge-tts python package which requires text which will be parsed to audio.<br>
PDFs of NCERT consist of things like page numbers Section numbers and figures which is unacceptable in an audiobook.<br>
Thus they need to be converted to .txt format with unnecessary things out of the equation.
There are 80+ PDFs for 3 subjects which is impossible for me to complete or would take me a huge amount of time to complete.<br>
The app would benefit you and every student looking for a Ad-Free stupid-simple app that works without Internet. <br>
Such an app to my knowledge does not exist on Google Play Store or are paid.

**What I need you to do:** [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OOck2y2kTgLNAWDe8aaxQqRb3w5QRPd-/view?usp=sharing)<br>
After you have the text properly formatted share the link to the .txt file as a pull request (or just paste it in the issues) in Github.
